A safe environment offers us a freedom and well-being that is essential to a good quality of life.  Tandem Ville-Marie West and the CSU Off Campus Housing and Job Bank have initiated a new partnership to address crime prevention needs within our area.  The Dean of Students has generously offered to share costs of printing in support for this program.  We are also working in collaboration with Concordia Security.  Together, we are delivering a new workshop series catered to the Concordia community called HOJO Safe in the City.  We have also developed aHome Security Evaluation Tool.
