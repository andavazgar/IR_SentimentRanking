LEARNING AND IMPROVING FRENCH IN MONTREAL
One of the greatest obstacles that students encounter when looking for jobs is the requirement of proficiency in French. Often times, in the job postings, employers list their requirements for the following four categories and indicate whether each of them is an “asset” or a “necessity”: oral English, written English, oral French, and written French.
Because of the language laws in the province of Quebec, if you work in a medium-sized company or a large company, you are required to speak French at the workplace. In addition, anyone has the right to be served in French, which means that if your job involves interacting with the public, you are required to speak French with francophone clients.
Learning French is a lengthy and somewhat painstaking process; it requires an intense passion for the language to master it. If your goal is to live and work in Quebec after you graduate, then studying and improving French is definitely necessary.
