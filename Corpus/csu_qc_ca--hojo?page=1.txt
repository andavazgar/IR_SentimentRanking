Housing and Job Resource Centre (HOJO)
Mission
The CSU's Off Campus Housing and Job Bank is your on-campus resource on housing issues and workers' rights. We provide legal information to students, offer a classifieds website to find work and housing, and give workshops across campus and in the community. Visiting HOJO does not require an appointment; simply come by our office in mezzanine of the Hall Building if you have questions or require assistance. HOJO has a series of annual campaigns on themes such as unpaid internships, housing sanitation, and rental increases.
We offer accessible resources to find safe, clean, and affordable housing in Montreal. Our office has a computer and phones to use if you have just arrived and need a place for your search.
