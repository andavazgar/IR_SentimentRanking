Public safety alert
Social media campaign targets women students
Posted on November 13, 2017

By: Lisa Ostiguy and Roger Côté
It has come to the university’s attention that social media invitations promising unsolicited professional development opportunities have been used to lure students off campus.
These invitations resulted in reported drugging and sexual assault. Montreal police have been informed and are investigating.
The university is cautioning students to be extra vigilant when responding to unsolicited social media offers.
If you have any information, or are in need of assistance, please contact:
Concordia’s  at , or
Concordia’s
at 514-848-3717, option 1.
We would like to take this opportunity to remind students that Concordia has zero tolerance for sexual violence of any kind. We are committed to creating and maintaining an environment that is safe for all.
